    "review": "It's definitely worth the money and it's a lot of fun, but I wish the crafting and resource gathering system were a little more versatile. The option to dye armor is a nice touch, but I'm not a huge fan of how easy it is to find high level armor crafting resources. Hopefully in the future they also add more types of armor that are not only dependent on player level, but also on finding rare crafting resources. Other than that no complaints, this game is great and I love it.",

    "review": "Played ESO during closed beta and didn't like it? Wondering should you start playing again now when Morrowind expansion is approaching? My answer is absolutely yes! The game has developed and updated rather nicely from that hideous thing that it was during closed beta.  One of the best things in the game is the Tamriel itself. The game world is large so you can waste hundreds of hours just doing exploration around (which also gives you experience points). Like in other Elder Scrolls games, ESO also has quite good amount of ingame lore books, which help you understand the story and, of course, lore itself. Game can be played as solo or in group, but end game content is rather group heavy (obviously, thanks to raids & dungeons).  Cashshop of the game doesn't have anything game breaking and gachapon stuff is cosmetics heavy, so no need to worry about those.  Overall, there has been only couple MMORPGs that I have truly enjoyed and I'm happy that I can include ESO: Tamriel Unlimited to those. ",

The quest are kinda boring.  You level up and the enemies stay at your level so theres no sense of getting stronger with level.  It would be nice to solo old content with a op toon like in wow if  you dont like to play in groups.  I did not notice a group finder cept for chat.  Im sure you can join a guild and run with them but i didnt see any random pug groups.  The game shadows and lighting are nice but the graphics are like im playing morrowind.  Once again i think im dissapointed with the fact i was hoping to see a elder scroll game.  Not a boring mmo.",

If the MMO aspect of the game has you worried (or automatically makes you hate it for some reason) It is done in such a way that I don't feel like its in my face all the time, which adds to the Elder Scrolls feel. But that being said there are some aspects of the game that do not transition flawlessly from single player RPG to MMO, such as the things you can steal (mainly items that are scattard about to give the environment more aesthetic) that are worth litteraly nothing, which makes sense from an MMO standpoint, but does not from every other perspective.  I think this game is not getting enough praise from its fans and should be held in higher regard. But be warned, ifyou want to feel as godly as you usually do in a Elder Scrolls game, be prepared to sink 400 hours into one character.",

    "review": "This game was a disaster during launch. But over the years it has evolved to one of the best mmorpg in the world right now. It's a balanced mix of TES story telling and competitive mmorpg game play. The combat system is dynamic and fun, much more complex than TES skyrim and feels you are actually hitting things. The pvp is ok but could be improved. Overall a great game and time sink.  Update since CWC:  Less grinding thanks to the transmutation, or maybe just an illusion since I have most of the sets.  The pvp experience is ruined by the lag, peeps running that miat shit cheating add-on, zerg ball.   Single player content and questing is still on par with elder scroll. Clock work city is definitely my favourite after Orsinium.   PVE feels slow because of the heavy attack meta. ZOS promised to make changes so let's see how they do it. They promised transmog but it probably takes another 6 months to implement.   Spoilers: apparantly next chapter of the game would be summerset...for once we are getting to go there. EXCITING!",

    "review": "+6000 saat sonra oyunu bırakınca incelememi güncelleme gereği duydum:     Otistik bir bireysiniz ve MMORPG oyun oynayarak PvP mi yapmak istiyorsunuz? 7 yıllık süreçte özellikle son birkaç yıldır gelen her güncellemeyle beraber Zenimax Online Studios (a.k.a. ZOS) sunucular lagdan geçilmiyorken ya da rekabetçi PvP içeriği hiç olmayıp Normal PvP içeriğinin de az olmasına rağmen bunlara odaklanmayıp tam tersine; organize, az çok da olsa yetenek, düşünme gücü ve bilgi gerektiren PvP'yi ortadan kaldırarak siz ''Casual'' otistik bireylerin de MMORPG oyunda PvP yaparak zevk alabilmesi için oyunu bu duruma kadar getirdi.      ZOS size artık ne kadar düşük IQ'ya sahip olursanız olun full defansif statlara vererek gerçek hayatta tekerlekli sandalyede olsanız bile sadece 1-2 tuşa basarak oyunda ölümsüz olabileceğiniz, yanında da oyuna dair hiç bir fikriniz olmasa da kendiliğinden hasar çıkartmasını geçtim bu konuda sizin toplam hasarınızdan daha iyi hasar çıkartan item setleriyle PvP'de size sonunda hayatınızda bir şeyi başarmışsınız hissi verecek metayı sunuyor. Dilerseniz Necromancer sınıfı gibi kendiliğinden rakibi takip edip sağlam ani hasar çıkartan, üstüne yavaşlatıp, can basmanızı azaltan roll-dodge atamadığınız YETENEĞİ yanında (evet yeteneği diyorum çünkü bunların hepsi bir yetenekte toplanmış durumda) bir ton da defansif kiti olan sonradan eklenen 1-2 sınıfı oynayarak her ne kadar akli durumunuz kötü olsa da oyunda başarılı olacağınızdan zevk alarak oynayabilirsiniz. Baktınız hala mı gri ekranda yerde yatıyorken birisinin üzerinizde eğilip kalktığını görüyorsunuz ve bu durum narin egonuz mu incitti? IQ'nuza yakın 4-5 Türk daha bularak sizi kesen kişiyi gördüğünüz yerde kovalayabilirsiniz nasıl olsa 6 kişilik grupta kesemez derken... O da ne? Yine mi öldünüz? Eğer o kadar çaresizseniz merak etmeyin oyunda hile ve exploit de var, iyi eğlenceler.",

    "review": "UPDATE: Installed to Linux Mint 19 using the latest Proton engine. So far the game has worked without issue under Mint and Steam Proton. Kudos!  *** Original Review *** Haven't encountered any bugs on the first three hours of playthrough and that's a good thing. The graphics are pretty and questing has been pretty good so far. I got a mount right out of the gate for the gold edition with no sub so that's pretty cool. Don't expect Skyrim as an MMO in here though.  Mage type class seems less diverse then what it was in Skyrim. I loved playing a pure caster in Skyrim and playing with lightning, fire, ice, etc. Here I can't seem to play that way so far which kind of turns me off to playing a caster. Also picking a caster class had me start out with a discarded great sword which really didn't sit well with me.  Since I liked melee better in Oblivion then Skyrim I figured I'd give that a go and started a dual weilding assassin type character. That seemed to go much better on the initial play through. Still got the great sword at the start but I discarded that for more appropriate dual dagger weapons. Not near as disappointing as the caster was starting out and on my initial impression.  This game has a built in UI for installing and managing add/ons. This puts it years ahead out of the gate for where World of Warcraft is when it comes to add/on managing. I don't remember seeing anything like that in WoW before baked in to the game itself like that.  The UI is decent, not as touchy feely tablet like as Skyrim was and that's a good thing. Takes a little getting used to though out of the box for me. Unlike SWTOR and WoW it seemed there was a slightly increased learning curve to finding things.  So far the combat has been good for me when fighting bad guys. Slid easier in to that because it feels like Elder Scrolls combat. The crafting system seems a tad overwhelming at first. I couldn't find any trainers and soon realized out of the gate you know all the profession and can harvest and such. Just no recipies to make anything right off.  The game is pretty good out of the box. I'd recommend giving it a try.  Finally, this game NEEDS a Linux version.  3/26/2017 Update - The more I play this game the more some things don't sit well with me. The UI itself seems kind of bleh to me. Stuff doesn't stand out like in other game and it feels hard to read. It's not terrible but it's annoying.  Also I noticed that even though I'm playing a rogue type character I'm getting a lot of plate and cloth rewards from quests. That is kind of annoying since there are some skill perks which reward rogue types for using all medium armor.",

Perhaps people need to upgrade/update their routers and modems, buy extenders, upgrade their nic cards, or PC's.  It takes about 10 seconds for the game to terminate your session.  Often most average users don't realize their internet is having issues.",

    "review": "It's the best MMO I've played so far, having played others like WOW, Guild Wars, Planetside, Archage, etc...  As an Elder Scrolls fan I think the game is fascinating. What Bethesda and Zenimax have done with the game since launch has made it into a really good and fun to play game. Yeah, sure, some stuff is locked behind pay walls, like dlcs and cosmetic (utterly useless, just fun to have a look at while you play) stuff, but mostly everything is obtainable through gameplay. And it's not like microtransactions are something new, they're sadly everywhere nowadays, but it makes sense to have things to pay for. And if you like the game, then why not spend a few more bucks for that thing you really, really want and can't get otherwise?  But I digress.  The game is fun to play, PVE and PVP. I've always wanted a chance to play an Elder Scrolls game with my friends and, even though there's a mod for Skyrim that does that, now I can, in a new, vivid, and beautiful game.  I highly recommend, if you're still skeptical, you give it a try.",

    "review": "I've given this game a positive review because I do after MUCH perseverance think this is a good game. However it really does throw you in at the deep end, from the total lack of explaination of basic game mechanics to vague quest markers, it's really not noob friendly and as a new player was daunting and frustrating to try and get into.  I would have given this game a negative review had it not been for this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPBNdeLCRsQ   whilst lengthy it gives you all the basic information you need to really get started with the game, because behind all of that cluelessness and lack of tutorials there is a fantastic game here. Some people will pick the game up easily and this won't be a problem for them, but if you're like me and you were totally clueless at first take the time to learn about it, you shouldn't have to as ideally, it would be explained in the game, I get that, but it is worth the extra work in my humble opinion.",

When I came back from my holiday I though yeah time to install the game and give it ago and muck around with mates. Little did I know not only could I have gotten it cheaper else where but I would have also avoided THE TERRIBLE SUPPORT FOR TRYING TO FIX THE GOD DAMN BROKEN LAUNCHER I'VE DOWNLOADED THE GAME 4 TIMES IN THE LAST 12 HOURS 56.9 GIG EVERY TIME AND THE DOWNLOADED FILES DON'T EVEN HAVE THE LAUNCHER INSIDE OF IT I CAN'T LAUNCH THE THING I NEED TO UPDATE THE GAME LET ALONE PLAY IT AND THE SUPPORT IS ALL BUT NON EXISTENT THE ONLY THING SUPPORT SAYS TO DO IS UNINSTALL THE GAME IF THE CODE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS THE WRONG ONE! WELL GUESS WHAT THE CODE ISN'T EVEN THERE FOR ME WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW. I PUT IN THE EXACT PROBLEM I HAVE IN TO THE SUPPORT PAGE AND THEN IT JUST TELLS ME \"Oh ask the community\" WELL SHIT I DIDN'T KNOW THE COMMUNITY WAS SUPPOSED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE GAME THAT THE GOD. DAMN. DEVELOPERS. IF I TRY AND VERIFY THE GAME IT JUST REDOWNLOADS THE WHOLE GAME AGAIN BECAUSE APPARENTLY ALL THE FILES FAIL TO VERIFY EVEN THOUGH I JUST DOWNLOADED THEM ALL God damn it steam. TL;DR  my steam download isn't downloading the launcher for the game and I'm unable to contact any support at all to try resolve my issuse and I am unable to link my account to ESO.com because for some reason the code I would need to do that just isn't there",

    "review": "I used to enjoy this game but after they announced the new \"chapter\", Morrowind...I can't in good conscience recommend this game to anyone now.  This company explicitely stated when they went buy to play that 1) subscribers would have access to all DLC releases for their loyalty, and 2) that all content would be purchasable with crowns and crown packs.  This new \"chapter\" will not be available to either.  I am not a subscriber, but I do purchase crowns with the express purpose to buy DLC, and had been sitting on 6000 crowns explicitly for a release such as this.  It's such a shady move on the part of Zenimax and Bethesda to take this course, especially toward people who have been subscribed since release and had been loyal customers through thick and thin.  It sucks I already paid for this, and that I can't get it through my prefered method of purchase while they already got my money...but you live and you learn.  I'll be avoiding both future Bethesda titles and future Zenimax Online Studios products if they were to work on anything besides ESO.  I wont say you should do the same, but definitely think about what you're supporting before making your purchases.",

    "review": "The Elder Scrolls® Online: Tamriel Unlimited™ - short TESO is often mistaken for an MMORPG. Which it is not.    TESO is an RPG with social elements. Since the Tamrial One update the whole world scales with yourself - everything is available from the start, and everything is always on par with you. The whole game can - besides group dungeons and raids - be finished solo.  There are, however, a lot of social sides. Crafting, Guilds, Guild Markets, soon to be implemented housing, all this plays a big role. Grouping up to beat a world boss or running dungeons with friends improves the game a lot.    Leaving aside the mistake above, the game is simply great! Questing is a lot of fun and quite varied, you will have hundreds of hours to spend if you want to finish everything. THe dungeons are challenging, the crafting system is very nice and the endgame is incredibly varied! There is not \"best\" equipement to get, what you need soley depends on your build and what you aim to be. The incredibly high amount of skill points allows skilling more than just one \"role\".   If there is any downside to be found, it's most probably the crown shop. Selling crafting motifs, mounts, pets, exp scrolls, style items [...] really takes away something. Your best choice is to get the DLC's you want in a sale and skip the rest of the things.   (comparison: the game in gold edition in a sale - 20€. 1 Crafting motif - 40€)  They even introduced case gambling recently... as if there werent enough of those on steam allready.   The cashgrabbing part doesn't mean i don't like the game. It's just the shadow that keeps disturbing the fun every now and then.   Overall, highly recommended. One-time-pay RPG with Social elements and hundreds of hours to spend on - really worth your money.",

    "review": "I first tried this game back when it was in closed beta, and I dont know why, but I did not enjoy the game at all. I play a lot of MMORPGs with the most time spent in EverQuest and World of Warcraft, I've also put in a fair amount of hours into the Elder Scrolls games as well. And while at first I think their mesh of trying to morph the gameplay style of Elder Scrolls with the gameplay of most MMOs initially failed, this game has grown on me. I tried it again a month ago and havn't been able to stop playing since. I'm not sure if it was the One Tamriel update or what, but just the feel of the game is different. The questing is fun and the storyline is interesting. Crafting is useful and doesn't feel tedious. The combat system is engaging and doesn't require too much button mashing or too much resource management. I feel like this game is in a very good state.  It does push you towards paying the subscription, not that is necessary to be better in the game, however without the crafting bag, inventory space can become a pain to manage. This doesn't bother me however, as I find subscription games tend to be superior and worth the price if they can deliver.",

    "review": "Elder Scrolls Online: 10/10   Where to start....I know. This game to start off is not the Elder Scrolls experience one would be used to (havock physics, single player, Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, etc.). It is a MMO but, with the rich, humourus, deeply lore friendly environment of the elder scrolls universe.  In fact, many of the mechanics present in lets say Skyrim is still available in ESO. For example, one can be a thief, an assassin, a mage, or a warrior. I believe the two most exciting aspects of ESO would have to be one, despite the class you choose as with your first character, you are NOT bound to the aspects of that class. For example, one could potentially pick to be a sorcerer for their class. At first one would think that, \" Oh, I'd have to have light armor or staff with my character at all times.\" NOPE! You can specialize in dual wielding, two hander, or whatever skill line you choose for your weapon while spitting lightning bolts out of your hands! Well, something like that anyway. What I'm trying to say is that one can be whatever they want to be in ESO. Wanna be a Destruction Staff wielding badass with a class of NIght Blade? Or how bout a two handed axe wielder who just so happens to also have serious skills with sorcery as well? ESO lets you build your way. The next aspect I EXTREMELY enjoyed about ESO is the questing and exploration of ESO. Remember when you were playing Skyrim and saw that cave and wondered what is was only to find out is was full of vampires trying to suck the life out of ya? Or how about just exploring an elder scrolls world lead to rewards and sweet side quests? ESO uses this aspect to its full potential. When I'am traveling through, lets say, Auridon(High Elf territory) I randomly was exploring locales of the island when a random event triggered, which spawned Daedra who were sent to kill me! Or this one time I was jumped by a group of bandits! But remember, these are all random events like in other Elder Scrolls experiences! I even stumbled upon a cave that led me to a shrine of Mehrunes Dagon, which prompted swarming Daedra. The questing and story telling of ESO is something written very well and I thoroughly enjoyed due one, it was just plain fun and two, learning more and more about lore is awesome.  Let me wrap this up, if you want an online Elder Scrolls experience which is fun and rewarding, get ESO. And add me!",

    "review": "We need to talk about Elder Scrolls Online. It's a very good game, with a lot to offer. But it also has its problems.  Pros: - The best thing about Elder Scrolls Online is its vast and immersive world. The game is set in the world of Tamriel, and players can explore the lands of the Dunmer, the Nords, and many other iconic Elder Scrolls races. The game's story is engaging and well-written, and there are plenty of interesting characters to meet along the way.  - One of the very good aspects of the game is its combat system. The game offers a variety of weapons, abilities and classes to choose from, allowing players to play in their own style. The combat is fluid and engaging, making it a joy to fight enemies.  - Another pro of the game is its strong player community. The game has a dedicated and active player base, which makes it easy to find groups for dungeons and quests.  Cons: - One of the most problematic aspects of the game is its pay-to-win nature. This means that players who are willing to spend more money on the game have a significant advantage over those who are not. This can be frustrating for players who are trying to compete on a level playing field.  - One of the main complaints is the subscription model, which requires players to pay a monthly fee to access all content. This can be a barrier for some players, especially when compared to other games in the genre that offer free-to-play options.  - Additionally, the game's DLC can be expensive and often feels like a grind. This can be frustrating for players who are looking for a more streamlined and enjoyable experience.  - Another problem with Elder Scrolls Online is the frequent bugs that plague the game. I have spent a lot of time playing this game, and I have encountered countless bugs that have made the experience frustrating. These bugs range from minor annoyances to game-breaking glitches that can ruin an entire session.  Now comes my toxic side:   - Can't fix bugs, let us reward players with a useless pet. - Barely working PVP, I have a feeling that Cyrodill is dead; Always buggy and un-playable.  - I'm tired of running on my horse (yes, you read it right), I'm tired of seeing my weapons under my character etc. - Also I'm tired that blocking is not working properly.   There is much more to the list, but I'll keep it family friendly.   Overall, although I have spent more than 4000 hours playing Elder Scrolls Online, I have found it to be a very good game with some problematic aspects. In comparison to other games in the same genre, it is a solid choice, but it does have its flaws. It's important for players to be aware of these issues before jumping into the game.",

    "review": "Addicting at first, frustarting later on. Can basically be played solo. You will get much more enjoyment out of this game if you take the time to get into the storyline.  While ESO does some unique things in the MMO genre, it still follows many of the MMO tropes. Zones, Linear leveling, phasing, gearing, etc..  Not a Skyrim Not a WoW  It falls apart after some time. The free to play/pay store is okay, better than swtor, worse than wow. I can see several gamer audiences getting enjoyment out of this game. Time will vary by how hardcore the gamer is. Since it is addicting at the beginning, a gamer looking for endless stimulation will eventually get tired of the same limits and structured content.   It can help if you know or enjoy the Elder Scrolls lore.   PvP is always a mess like most games and barrier to entry for enjoyment is high. Having friends and guilds helps here.  I see this as something like swtor, an on-rails rpg with lots of character customization and decent story line. I think where this hybrid shines is the way it mixes up the predictably in a single-player RPG with multiplayer. It introduces this MMO component while trading off for less open world and continuity issues.  Mod support is almost necessary at least for inventory and crafting management.  Just like swtor, it had alot of the right things at some point of the development cycle but capitalization of any successes never push them into wildly succesful or breakthrough games to the community.",

ESO's developers have outdone themselves with the amazing graphics, depth of the DLC and the stunning world they have created. I am also an ESO Plus subscriber and having this has really enhanced my crafting. It's wonderful to have unlimited slots for crafting items and it's easy to level up within the crafting system. There are many different characters to choose from and three main groups to choose from, completely diversifying your experience.  Another bonus is that the community is amazing. While there is the usual \"zone chat\" issues, I have never been disappointed when asking a question. Friendly help is almost always around. Being able to belong to five guilds has opened up a whole world of trading opportunities. The guides and the Wiki have many indepth walkthroughs for those puzzles you just can't seem to figure out. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a great MMO.",

    "review": "I originally didn't recommend this game because of technical issues. They have been fixed. The game itself is a lot of fun. There's a ton of content to play through, and it's enjoyable even as a solo-player experience. The endgame is a little different than your typical MMO and provides some variety for gearing up and strengthening your character.   If you're looking for a traditional TES experience, you won't find it here. There are some similarities though. You'll encounter a lot of the places, lore, factions and characters you've encountered in some TES games but the gameplay is definitely nothing like those games. The music is great, and everything is fully voiced. Combat is similar to Guild Wars 2. You have 2 weapon skill bars (swappable in combat) with 5 skills and ultimate on each bar that you can customize and create some unique builds. This game is fun. Questing is enjoyable, the storylines are entertaining enough, PVP is fun (although annoying at low gear levels) and the game is adequately challenging. I definitely recommend this one to MMO fans, and TES fans alike.",

DLC is great and adds hours of content (excluding imperial city, thats awful)  Weaknesses 1. PVP is awful until you unlock endgame. 2. Fast travel is awful (compared to other ES games) 3. Crafting can be a pain and is useless until you max it out",

First time i download it it delete it self. second time it worked but i hadn't play it long time and after i tried to update it stuckted and i tried repair it. It didn't give me error or it didn't say it's reason and it deleted itself again when i tried repair it on steam.Then i realize it's reason there is no enough space. Now i download it again. My internet speed is too slow so eachdonload takes 2-3 days. I hope it work this time.  But game itself very good. I'm 40 lvl now(I've also 30 lvl another charecter). There is lot's of content and it isn't getting boring. Game content is really big. DLC's are very expensive. I suggest you wait for crown discounts. Levels are well-designed(somtimes you can get stuckted on a rock or a barrel). Game mechanics are better than lots of mmorpg. There is lots of classes and races. It's not Skyrim. So don't expect that kind a game. I hope they'll fix game installer.  (Sorry for my misspelings and grammer mistakes)",

    "review": "I can't even get myself getting out of starting zones playing other MMORPGs, but ESO has made me gone from helping a moon sugar farmer getting rid of bugs to uniting an alliance to confronting the God of Schemes himself. It's a huge playground where you can go anywhere with a lot of things to do. Graphics arent the best but it's really pleasant and combined with amazing sounds will make you feel immersed in the world of Tamriel. There's a setback from all of these which is lack of depth in stories and conversations, although I've heard that they're better than most games in the genre. But tbh they're not too bad and they still can get me quite engaged sometimes.   9/10 - One of the best purchase I've ever had",

    "review": "DO NOT BUY THIS!  I spent a week trying to understand why the fuck the Launcher gets stuck in the middle of patching and guess what? THE FILES ARE CORRUPT. I kept re-downloading them through Steam integrity check and after that it locked me out of the Launcher since the corrupt files count as an Update. Uninstalled, reinstalled. Same thing. You can't run the game like that. Stay away from this! Maybe the one on their official website works but this is a scam. ESO Support refuses to help me. They spam \"We're sorry we haven't been able to help you. Ask if you have any further questions and we'll help.\" like wtf? This game is a very expensive scam. Fucking never again am i buying an 80GB game with a Launcher.   Edit:I tried using the repair function before verifying through Steam. The piece of crap crashed on 3% and overloaded my disk capacity.  PS:Oh and by the way, the Launcher counts as Playtime. That's right, if you fail to download the patches (which you will) under 2 hours, say bye bye to your money.",

    "review": "TLDR   Pros:  Open-ended class/character customization Tons of content for solo + MMO vets Fantastic gameplay Improved world building + features PvP options  Cons: Hard to play with lower level friends Cash shop/dlc monetization Character wide achievements Uninspired writing  My original review was a negative review posted in January of 2017 with 40 hours of game time.  Since I've put in another almost 1000 hours into this game since, it's clear my opinion has changed a bit since then.  I have included the original review at the bottom as I will be referring back to it from time to time, and I still think that review has merit compared to the state of the game at the time.    Since having gone through several updates, major expansions, and various dlcs, The Elder Scrolls Online has become probably my favorite MMO on the market today.  Many of the old gripes that I had in this game have been ironed out and the game is bursting with features and content to suit anyone's needs.  ESO has put in a ton of work to carve out it's own identity in the MMO landscape.  In my previous review, I said that ESO was a mix of single-player and MMO, but couldn't really satisfy either.  Well, after several years, they have found a way to satisfy both!  Most of the major expansions feature a new part of Tamriel with a new story and zone to quest in, each adding hundreds of lore books to read and discover for those elder scrolls savants out there.  These zones come with dailies, new features and mechanics, classes, dungeons, and trials (I'll come back to these last two later) for the hardcore crowd.  This content ensures that no matter what type of player you are, you will find plenty to do!  Gameplay is still great, being a more action centered combat vs the \"stand and hit buttons on a timer\" combat of some others.  This also leads to pretty high skill ceilings for most content especially PvP.  More Elder Scrolls like features have been added to the game like home buying, real crime systems that add to the realism and making you feel like you're apart of the world.  PvP has been expanded from just the vast open-world PvP to include smaller \"battlegrounds\" to satisfy that niche better as well.  Character creation is still great, as well as crafting, with each expansion adding more armor styles to collect.  Due to the nature of how the classes function, you can create any type of character you want with any weapon and skill combination.  While a meta still exists, players are free to play with any race-class-weapon combination out there, and you will still have success in at least solo and normal ranked dungeons.  Along with the many gear sets out there, this game encourages you to experiment with your own builds, which is a refreshing change to the standard class progression in most other MMOs.   Not everything is sunshine and roses though, as I still have many issues with this game.  As I said in my old review, it's still a pain in the ass to quest with friends.  You can be in the same group, but if you have already completed the quest your friend is on, you can't help them.  This makes it to where you need to make a new character if you want to quest with a lower level friend.  This game also has some of the worst monetization I've seen in a while.  While the game has been \"buy-to-play\" for quite some time now, it still has an in-game store.  This damn store sells everything you can imagine at unbelievably high prices.  From cosmetics to houses, expansions to xp boosts, this store is shameless.  In fact, almost all mounts and unique player cosmetics in the game come from the store, with no other means of getting them.  Remember when I said I'd come back to the dungeons, well guess where you get the expansion dungeons that aren't in the base game?  That's right, not from the expansion you bought, but from another separate charge.  These $60 expansions don't actually come with dungeons, you need to spend another $30 to get the \"dungeon dlcs\".  It's ridiculous that the coolest gear and items aren't unlocked with hard work or completing achievements, but through your wallet.  Speaking of achievements, there are thousands of them!  Many of them have titles or rewards associated with completing them like dye colors etc.  The problem is that they are not account wide but instead character wide.  That means finishing an achievement on one character doesn't unlock it for all your characters, you need to do it again on your alts.  Why they made this decision is beyond me, and it makes playing alts that much harder to stomach, in my opinion.  The writing is also very suspect in my opinion.  When the game first launched, it made a big deal about the faction war and it's main story about daedric invasions.  Races were separated into 3 groups of alliances that all hate each other etc. while Molag bol is using \"gates\" to invade.  Well, the alliances have only been used to set up the PvP and base game questing, whereas the whole daedric invasion has already been done in TES 4 Oblivion, but better.  That is also a recurring theme in Zenimax's writing, constantly stealing ideas from past TES games to fit their world.  Let's go through the past expansions shall we.  Wrothgar was the first actual major expansion bringing a story about orcish politics, I liked it.  It was something new we hadn't seen before.  After that, we went to Vvardenfell to deal with the tribunal losing power, hmmm... that sounds kinda familiar... Next, we went to Summerset Isle to deal with more daedric invasions... Then Elsweyr to fight dragons... then to Skyrim to fight vampires... and now Blackmarsh to fight Mehrunes Dagon, the very guy from TES 4...  Do you see what I'm talking about here?  Zenimax seems to have run out of actual creative ability for storytelling years ago, unless they just want the nostalgia to get these overpriced expansions to sell.  Listen, these stories will probably entertain most, and that's fine.  It just puts a bad taste in my mouth that I feel like I'm having deja vu every expansion.       Having said all that, I still have almost 1000 hours in this game, and I think it has improved a ton since it first came out in 2015.  While the long list of negatives bugs me, it doesn't keep me from having a great time in this game.  I think there is a lot to offer here, unfortunately at a high price, to any fan of the elder scrolls and MMO vets alike.  The base game goes on sale multiple times a year, so if you're not quite sure after all that, I'd recommend giving it a shot then.  Old Review (This is a weird frankenstien mess of a game.  It tries to satisfy both single player elder scrolls fans with hardcore mmo vets, and it fails to please either.  While there are some things to write home about, like the character creator, crafting, and pvp, there is no freedom of choice to do anything or even basic elder scrolls elements like crime etc.  As for the mmo side, this is the most solo experience ive ever had in an mmo.  No grouping, no global auction house, and quests are the most boring excuses for activities ive ever seen,  Listen, if youre a hardcore ES fan, then maybe you can press on.  Otherwise, if you tell me something you like in this game, odds are i can name you a free game that does it better.)",

We are ZoS, we care more about money than your actual satisfaction, if you read the EULA, we bear no responsiblity for anything, even if its our fault, still not our fault. 3. Raise a fuss because we have broken stuff, BAN!  Now my hours dont reflect this, 800 CP, All pve complete, former emps. I have over 5k forsure.  I reccommend this game if you have poured time and money into, if not, stay the fuck away from this greedy company.  I won't list the the pros or cons because frankly, the servers suck, cheat engine is still around, broken add ons, giant zerglag balls, I can only suspect things will get worse with the new patch.  Since I played, a new patch has never gone off without major game breaking things. 2 years in, still have elementary glitches, bugs, exploits that still havent been fixed.",

    "review": "I put all my time into the PS4 version, but I've been informed the PC version is similar in its deficiencies.  ESO is, by far, the best Standing in Town simulator yet. If you're the type who likes to stand in town for hours upon hours pretending to be AFK, your ship has come in. For those of us who like to progress through PVE content into endgame, you either better come with 3-12 friends or be tolerant of idiots who infest public queues.   Because raids are small, no established or even up and coming guilds recruit, and since you can be a member of 5 guilds at once, you will never find the type of close-knit, familial guild environment that other MMORPGs offer. ESO is the most anti-social MMO I have ever played and it's why I quit. In nearly a year of play, I did not meet one person with whom I grouped more than once, and not for lack of trying. The other players in the world may as well be NPCs.",

I had barely any hours in it but eecently I came back to it after the One Tamriel update and the game has changed a ton I started playing it with 2-5 friends and besides the main story line being dull I love the game now. This is coming from someone who has played many other mmos before but couldn't get into them but for me this one is different.

My actual screen resolution is 1536 x 864. The one I choose for most games is 1600 x 900 and that always works, but choosing that resolution in this game still streches the screen out. I don't want to use windowed fullscreen mode because the mouse has a mind of it's own.  I have seen plenty of games with a far smaller budget than you guys, so I am sure that this can be fixed and that there aren't any excuses to why this problem can't be fixed.",

I just can't get into it because it looks so last-generation and washed out color-wise and, well, just mediocre at best. Looks like Age of Conan level graphics which is a big step backwards.",

I bought/downloaded the game while it was on sale, but would definitely have paid full-price knowing what I do now. The first 10 levels are actually a bit of a grind before you unlock group dungeons, but the storyline is complex, and I enjoy randomly stumbling upon quests while just running aimlessly in a direction for a while. Definitely recommend!",

    "review": "On release, I ignored this game because it looked like any generic fantasy MMO.  Today, it's a completely different game.  You don't need to grind just to visit new areas.  You can explore and run quests anywhere you want, just like a real Elder Scrolls game.  You can play any class however you want.  You can sneak around towns, pick locks, and rob people blind.  The lore is here, the writing for most of the quests and sidequests are great, crafting is great, combat is great, this is everything an Elder Scrolls game is but with a different combat system.  I hate generic fantasy MMOs.  I freaking love Elder Scrolls Online.  It's now a true Elder Scrolls game, albeit with other players running around.",

However, I keep coming back because I keep getting kicked off due to server timeouts, or quiting because of massive lag spikes that make the game unplayable. I want to like this game. I want to play it everyday. I want to buy crowns to support further development. But the issues are far too annoying and make me want to just quit, play something else and come back to see if they have resolved their issues in a few months.",

    "review": "While I haven't played long enough to get into the nitty gritty - extreme details of the game, from the first few hours (60) I've experimented with every class and seen the beginnings of every region. And honestly... i'm blown away. Not soon after playing did I buy the DLCs and the Imperial class... and some other cosmetics... don't judge me...   The classes are cool, skills are fun, game environment and aesthetics are boooootiful, great amount of visual character customisation for the characters through a system reminiscent of Skyrim's (though there's slightly less options for ESO) and the community even in game is great! Wait at a dungeon for a min or two and 4 to 5 guys appear and you party together!   It's an mmo at heart, so if you're into this kinda thing then go ahead, I think you'll like it! I'm not so into them but being a ES fan I had to try ESO out... was not disappointed. Also, doesn't require a beastly PC etc, first time I played was on a Macbook Pro, so perfect for those that have lower spec comps.",

I complained about the combat and how there were designated buttons for certain moves that your character could perform like in World of Warcraft. It didn't feel like past Elder Scrolls Games I played. Then I realized I had been trying to play the game as if it were Oblivion or Morrowind and not like the MMO the creators intended it to be. From that point on, I have been engrossed in the world of tamriel. Every place is unique, all the quests are fun and I finally learned to love the combat. The world is massive and brimming with interesting characters and places to explore. Do yourself a favor and pick up this game when you get the opportunity.",

    "review": "This game is so immersive, its LOREGASMIC!  Love to roleplay and quest solo?  Be a part of group and delve in dungeons?  Be a soldier in the army of your alliance and PVP all the way to seize the imperial capital? This game has something for you.  Whether you choose play solo, PVE, PVP, or all the above, your will level up your character and have fun nonetheless.  The game is so flexible, that it gives you the freedom to choose that path you want to take to level your character.  You can mix and match skills, weapons, clothing, and armor you have acquired to make your character unique to your own playstyle.  After hundreds of hours play, the grind doesn't feel tedious, nor boring.  The positive, helpful, and friendly community is also a big plus,   ESO had a bad start, but that is all behind us now.    As much as I love the game, it has some drawbacks, especially if you love hoarding loot, and if you want to excel in crafting.  Having ESO plus would make your life a lot easier because you get a craft bag which has unlimited space that stores all the crafting materials and ingredients you have acquired. The craft bag is shared with the 8 character slot the game gives you.  There are ways around it without ESO plus, but it can quite tedious.  Out of the 8 characters you can build, use one (or more) of them as a 'mule'.  Once you current main character is running out bank and bag space, logout your main character. Login with the character you assigned as the mule and unload all of the items you do not want to trash to your designated mule.  This can be quite tedious.  Since I got ESO on sale for around 10 bucks, I figured I stick with the plus subscription for a couple of months.    Also, avoid the crown crates 'slot machine' section of the game.  I think this a distasteful move for ZOS to have this in the game, There are other ways to make revenue and this seems like a trap that can get addicting for those who have a gambling tendency.  This game is addicting enough as it is.",

    "review": "(Old Review) Very fun game, especially with dungeons and quests that give a bunch of EXP for finishing. I really enjoy playing ESO, but mostly my problem is getting a \"Build\" setup for myself. Other than that its a wonderful and outstanding game. I rate it 9.5/10 (since there are some player and terrain bugs here and there not as much as Skyrim though!) I highly suggest playing if you like MMO/RPG/Medieval kind of games!  Years later: I still enjoy playing the game, however it becomes stale very quickly. The PvP is in need of desperate attention, they've added Battlegrounds (BGs for short) that they HAVE NOT UPDATED since it was implemented, except for a few game-breaking bugs of course. Meanwhile, in recent months (of September 2022) we had some Chaos-Ball and Capture the Relic Weekends (event), but for some reason no Deathmatch weekend ever happened.  The game is itself is still nice however, requiring you to level up, get better gear through grinding, buying, or crafting your gear all in PvE aspects of the game (mostly) so that you can use it in PvP, or have other gear that is viable.  After completing maxing out three characters and classes, the game is very dull and mindless to play, especially for players who have completed everything at least once on a character, to repeat it more and more is just depressing - Once you've reached \"end-game,\" in ESO, you can either continue to mindlessly grind or create a new character and do it again lol",

    "review": "I'm absolutely addicted. Can't pry away. I love the character customization, I love the class customization. While there may be only four classes, there are hundreds of possibilities. Unfortunately all the guides on the \"meta\" are really outdated. What does that mean? That you can do whatever you want as long as it works for you... and that makes it FUN! I love the quests, the sass of the characters. I love it that it's unique in that the quests aren't purely \"Kill 20 pigs and turn it in for gold\" it's usually miniature stories throughout the world, in wonderful \"The Elder Scrolls\" fashion. You save people, you have to find things, liberate a fort, everything has it's own story. The dungeons are so much fun. I love healing, Tanking is challenging, and dpsing.. well.. I can't say it's not what it sounds like. There are a lot of things to do to level up. You can grind, you can dungeon, you can delve, you can explore, you can open chests, the list goes on! It's a totally customizable experience based on your preferences. The gear and costumes are awesome. I love seeing a good gear-set of a high level character, or seeing a hard-to-get costume and swooning over it. There are even personalities that your character can have... Want an edgelord assassin? Join the Dark Brotherhood and toss knives around when you idle! Feel like a hero? Find the heroic personality and puff out your chest! What about if your character is a drunk..? They have one for that too! This isn't ESO Beta. They've improved their game on every level. It is definitely worth a try.",

    "review": "Hello future Tamriel heroes,  I have bought this game recently and absolutely love it! The story is great and there are lots of options and ways to play together with your friends (especially now that level does not matter so much anymore). In my 200-something hours that I have played this I have not touched all the content yet and have not been bored once! The DLC's are very fun as well as they give you extra skill trees and awesome cutscenes (especially the assassins guild :P).  However, I would NOT buy this game via Steam though but as a single client. Pretty often when they do an update of the accounts etc it seems to go wrong with the users for the steam client (like right now its been over 24h and while I am paying for it my ESO+ has been disabled). Don't let that discourage you from buying the game though!   Just keep in mind this is not Skyrim or any of the Elder Scrolls games, so dont compare it with that :) Enjoy the journey and every aspect this game has to offer and you are good to go :)",

    "review": "If you're a fan of the Elder Scrolls, from other games like Skyrim, Morrowind, Oblivian etc, this will feel natural to you, yet be new enough to get you interested all over again.  The constant expensive updates, extensive amount of paid content and not so friendly community are my only complaints about this game.  The servers are pretty reliable, bugs get addressed in a timely manner, the game performs well even with old/outdated and or mediocre equipment you can get some decent eye candy.  As usual from the franchise the stories are deep and plentiful.    All the old exploits are gone, they managed to balance the game well this time.  You can play by yourself, follow the story and level up your way, but at some point, for the sake of good gear, you'll probably end up grinding in dungeons like everyone else.  The community isn't very friendly, lots of infighting, tanks and healers are hard to come by, lots of DPS out there because PVP.  There are lots of cool hou$e$, mount$ and other thing$ you can purcha$e, but you're gonna pay!$$$$$$$   The updates are all paid, so new zone, cough up $49.99 every time, or wait 5 years and cough the money up, when doesn't matter, only when the next update comes out does.  Personally I think they expect gamers to pay too much per year if they are active, and want all the content  to be up to date.  Think WOW.  You can instead purchase ESO Plus (monthly subscription) last time I did it was $14.99/month base and you get discounts if you purchase lots of time, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year etc which also gives you a bag you can store an unlimited amount of crafting mats in, all content while you play and some crowns (in game currency)  Crowns are expensive if you pay full price, wait for the sale, it's coming, but be ready to drop $100-$200 on crowns when there is a sale so you have enough to buy all the other stuff... see where this is going... On the bright side, the game is old, like 2014, you can get 9 years of $49.99 ish updates for... $49.99, which is $49,999 (exaggeration) cheaper than if you bought the updates as they came out.  I wonder if anyone knows what the actual total cost of ownership of this game not including things like crafting tables, storage furniture houses etc is?? My guess is somewhere between $1000 and $5000 if you bought all the updates that came out as they were released and played from day 1 till present which some people have.  To take a shot from the hip, I'd say ESO got me for about $1200-$1500 when I played regularly between updates, subscription fees, crowns, real estate, mounts, and all sorts of stuff I didn't need but wanted.  Good for you bean counters.  I didn't hate the experience, but it got old fast when i needed gear I had to grind grind grind.  I may play it again, again wasn't the worst game ever but not worth what it costs to play.",

    "review": "Definetely big improvements from the early stages of development. It's quite a nice RPG and if all the dungeons will be free (as they should be) and you won't see that much of a difference between the subscription user and the \"free\" user, I would really, really recomment this game as one of the best MMORPGs out there. But as it is now, for me, a person that bought only the game, with no DLCs and no subscription, it's just an incomplete RPG that has loads of potential but was given to a company that's just milking it. (Why Bethesda, why ?)   So, is this game bad ? Not really, but you should keep in mind that you need DLCs to unlock the whole fucking map and one DLC costs around 15 Euros so there's like 75 bucks to unlock the whole map, and all the storylines which feel like they should be ALREADY THERE ! There's a lot of good parts to it as well, like for example the complex combat system which allows each class to be good in their own way.   I could go all day about the awesome world and exploration systems but that would just kill my previous point, and I will give this game a positive review even if it needs free DLCs more than anything else.",

As i finished skyrim i saw this title in steams store. I instantly bought the gold package for 80$ canadian.  WHAT A PIECE OF F*CKIN GARBAGE! THIS GAME SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO CARRY THE ELDER SCROLLS TITLE!  I FEEL AS IF IVE BEEN ROBBED FOR 80$! I WANT MY GOD DAMNED MONEY BACK U PIECES OF CRAP!  but since thats not likely to happen as the money hungry poop studios aparantly even tried to get people to pay monthly, ill settle for never buying another game from them ever..   bethesda please take this game back!",

I enjoy the graphics of the game, although they do differ somewhat from traditional Elder Scrolls graphics. The game runs great on my PC, as well as my Macbook Pro retina while on the go. I've played 48 hours thus far and feel like I've barely scratched the surface of the available content. If you're considering this game I would definately reccomend it. The price is reasonable at $20 for a base game and the amount of content recieved at this price point is great.",

ESO is the first MMORPG game I've played and all I can say that it definitely gets a thumbs up from me from the dungeons and flexibility of the skills tree.  Despite NA being the most saltiest region in the world, ESO has many friendly players that will help you in the game. I have yet to encounter toxic players in the game.  Would totally recommend for people who are getting into the MMORPG field.",

    "review": "I've been playing this game since last spring (2016), and it worked fine until the update that nullified levels. Now you can play just long enough to get hooked before the serious server lagging starts and you eventually get logged off or booted. To play so much, with or without Eso membership and extras, and end up with a game that barely works is quite vexing. Seriously, there is a problem when a game like Wizard 101 works better then this one.  Besides the obvious technical problems, the game has beautiful music, it is graphically better then Skyrim, has a good enough story and great freedom though doing the missions is still essentiel to unlocking certain things. The crafting is a bit harder due to refining and advance material location, but you can add bonus to your items as well as enchanting them. Money is still hard to find, like many of these games, but I've seen worst. Other players are as they've always been, very nice to very...not so nice, but I've mostly seen the helpful neutral type. It is very possible to play on your own and I have yet to find a guild and learn how those work, so they are not necessary if you're a loner.  It is a possibly very good game, not the best but quite enjoyable never the less, if you can manage not to get lagged or booted off every 1/2 hour or less. If it wasn't for the technical problems, I would recommand this game when on special. As it is, I can only warn the obssessive buyers like me and tell them to look somewhere else for now.",

    "review": "From a 10/10 to a 4/10.  It's a beautiful game (if you can run it), there is a lot to do. and unique in it's own way. I wish I could be more positive about it. that I was in this update of what I think of the game. I'm still playing it, but way to much with a down face then with a smile. I hope I can change this review one day again to something positive.  PvP: This content became pay to win sadly, Also skill in this game not as important anymore. The makers focus on easy as possible playstyle, some classes peform extremely a lot better under it. Zerging is something very encouraged by sets and buffs that has been added and given. It hurts being negative about the content I used to love, It's just not anymore what it was.  Peformence: The game runs very bad. And the system requirements steam shows are far from enough. I guess it runs okay on a few thousend euro/dollar PC. Not for those that need to work for the bills.  Social: I met a good friend on it I that means a lot to me. Beside that it's quite the toxic community.  I doubt I should recommend it: They promise to improve the game, but they do that since a long time. And it has never been more frustrating as now. I absolutely love the game for years I played it, this is more my personal part. on the other side it leeches money, and misses diversity. The game makers are uninterrested in your opinion. I play it for 8 years now, never they have opened up for hearing an opinion. instead they ignore it and push to worse.",

    "review": "When I first Beta tested ESO I hated it. Coming from WoW, I thought the game mechanics were bad and it the game was lacking that special \"umph.\" After a year or so, I was bored with WoW and decided to try ESO one more time. I fell in love with it from the moment I logged in. The graphics are stunning. The quest are filled with detail. Everytime I play, it's like stepping into a vast new world with unlimmited possiblities. Everything runs smooth and although the leveling takes quite some time, it's enjoyable because most of the quests are intresting. I highly recommend this game.",

    "review": "Having loved Skyrim but found it difficult to get it to play well on my MAC - I thought that ESO would be the answer.   Sadly, for me it's not a patch on Skyrim.  For one reason the multiple player thing is a right pain.  There are always characters running past you or flaming some enemy.  This completely destroys the atmosphere especially when in lonely forgotten caves.  It's more like going to a medieval shopping mall.   Also, you could be fighting a difficult enemy when some Level 50 comes along and wipes it out.   Thirdly, the storylines are absolutely rubbish.  Dull and repetitive. I am now holding out for ES VII and hope there will be a Mac version.",

I love the customization of the characters, and the wide variety of quests and monsters. Getting to interact with other players can be very useful, especially when battling a particularly difficult beast. Overall, I would give this game at least a 9.5/10.",

    "review": "Absolutely DESPISE this game.  This worlds feels SO wrong.  1.)  God help you if your a left hander and want a key bind different than the default.  None of the key-bind prompts actually update to be in sync with your keybind.  So E is loot, no matter what loot really is. 2.)  Spent the first 10 minutes looking for mobs with nothing but other players absolutely overwhelming the area.  3-4 stacked on the same poor corpse.  I'll be darned before I go back to that kind of idiocy. 3.)  Everything is dark and undistinguishable - so NPCs, mobs, they're all the same.  They're scattered everywhere indiscriminately and don't have enough difference to be noticable. 3.)  The UI is insanely short on ANYTHING.  No minimap, no icons, nothing.   Just remember all 240282 keybinds necessary to do everything (see #1 about prompts for keybinds not updating). 4.)  The interaction is so counter-intuitive to what everyone's used to!  Just like when Microsoft makes a completely useless update to justify charging for anothre 'update'.   5.)  If you want to pay 70 dollars, you can have a horse.  Otherwise, grind for a MONTH to maybe get enough gold.  Absolute fail.",

I'd definitely reccomend this game to anybody.  The only thing that I find rather troublesome, is that if someone finds, say, a runestone, and another person finds it, if they claim the runestones first, then you can't get the runestones.  I find it a bit frustrating if I'm looking for runestones, and suddenly they disappear because someone else got to them.   Whatever, it's not really a problem, and I figure that's a bit more realistic.  Overall, Bethesda did a great job with streamlining this game.",

There are no error messages; the Launcher counts up to 100% and then just goes away. I have tried every potential fix I can find online.

    "review": "Well I originally avoided this game because of bad reviews at launch and the subscription model but now with the new buy to play model I decided to give ESO another chance. All i can say is I've felt like a fool for not trying this game sooner. Incredible immersion and the voice acting is superb. Combat is fun and feels impactful, music is epic and the questing system doesn't feel like so many other mmorpgs. ESO feels organic like everything is just happening naturally around you and you can choose to be a part of it or go about your business. love this game, can't wait to drop endless hours in.",

The stories and characters are too fantasy and uninteresting.   update - After playing it for a few days, i've started to like the game more and more...  Update - I now really love the game. It's one of my favorite games ever.. The game gets better and better as you put in more hours..",
